Initial Project Proposal
Due Tuesday by 3pm Points 5 Submitting a file upload Available after Feb 3 at 5pm
For your initial project proposal, think about the work you have done so far at GSAPP and in your other academic and professional careers. Reflect on who you think might have been the audience for prior research, data visualizations, and other projects you have worked on. If you are in or have been in a studio course, reflect on your client or community and their relevant needs.

With these things in mind, write an initial proposal (1/2 - 1 page) for a project you are interested in pursuing in this course. You are not expected to have a fully fleshed-out research goal or product in mind. In fact, the very opposite is true. Identify a potential community or use case (for example: climate researchers who need to visualize air quality changes over time, or a Bronx housing advocacy group who plans to push their local elected reps to support more affordable housing).

Include information on the three following aspects:

Project: What research topic or data are you interested in exploring

Product: High level idea of ways to present this information

People: Who you think your users/clients are and why they would benefit from your work

Submit your proposal as a pdf or word doc in paragraph form (no bullet points/lists), and think about how you want to communicate your ideas succinctly and effectively as you write.
