# Syllabus Annotations: Prototyping in Urban Tech

## Course Concept & Philosophy
- **Role of the Urbanist**: Storytellers, Information Arbiters, Information Advocates.
- **Core Ethos**: User-Centric Design. "Start with the end (users) to understand the value our work can provide."
- **Politics**: Urban data advocacy can reform laws, reshape environments, and activate community power.

## The "Golden Rule" / Formula
> **Project ⊃ Product ⊃ People**
- **People**: Users determine the need.
- **Product**: The tool that satisfies the need.
- **Project**: The research/data driven by the need and the tool.
*Note: The course flips this relationship in practice: People -> Product -> Project.*

## Assignment: Initial Project Proposal
- **Due**: Tuesday by 3pm (Spring 2026).
- **Format**: 1/2 - 1 page, PDF/Word, **Paragraph form (NO bullet points/lists)**.
- **Goal**: Identify a potential community or use case. "Not expected to have a fully fleshed-out research goal or product."
- **Key Components to Address**:
    1.  **Project**: Research topic or data to explore.
    2.  **Product**: High-level idea of presentation (app, map, dashboard, etc.).
    3.  **People**: Users/Clients and *why* they benefit.

## Key Themes for the Proposal
