# User Research Principles & Tactics

## Public Participation - Meaningful Collaboration with Stakeholders

- Reflect on our goals for engagement
- Identify where we are and where we want to be
- Budget our time and money (when relevant) for participation early

## Power Shift - Include the Excluded

- Identify people with marginalized and relevant meaningful lived experiences
- Map out stakeholders and find the gaps
- Be thoughtful and sensitive in crafting our outreach

## Transparency - Explain Purpose & Expectations

- Be explicit about your expectations
- Clarify how information will and won't be used
- Avoid specific promises for outcomes that you can't guarantee

## Benefits & Harms Disclosure - Identify and Share the Risks

- Explain any benefits and risks you can identify
- Remind participants that they are in control of how and in what ways they participate
- Provide consent forms, and clarify when (if ever) you may need to break confidentiality
- Encourage participants to say and do what makes them most comfortable, and that they can opt out at any time for any reason

## Accessible Language - Avoid Jargon & Be Context Responsive

- Check materials aren't filled with jargon and complex language
- Plan for translations if needed
- Walk through consent forms and accommodate impairments

## Fair Compensation* - When Feasible, Pay for People's Time

*(this is likely not going to be relevant for the scale of our projects)*

- When possible, offer compensation that is fair
- Don't bias recruitment with particular monetary values
- Always compensate at the start

## Data Control & Privacy - Minimize Data Collection & Keep it Safe

- Allow for opt-in and opt-out
- Limit what data you collect to directly meaningful information
- Avoid or anonymize personal identifiers
- Clarify how data is stored, who gets access to it, and what you will do with it

## Resource Connection - Point People to Meaningful Resources

- If you want to discuss sensitive topics, be a support system or ally
- Think through potential scenarios and be ready to help
- Consider how your help is appropriate and how it is not

# Conducting User Research

## Defining Scope - What we need to discover in order to start our design process

- Think about systems and understand which part(s) you want to engage with
- Develop research questions that are relevant, focused, and answerable

## Determining Participants/Potential Users - Recruit a diverse and meaningful group

- Map relevant stakeholders and their relationships to one another
- Seek out 'extreme' users as well as typical users
- Collect a large enough sample size for meaningful findings (aim for 10)
- Adapt your recruitment strategies to fit your populations
  - **On-the-ground**: meet people at your site of interest
  - **Snowball**: ask your network for their network
  - **Advertizing**: post digital/physical ads with links to material

## Determining Methods - Choose methods that fit our scope and needs

- Make sure our methods align with the findings we want and the nature of the project
- Employ multiple methods when possible
- Typical research methods include:
  - Semi-structured interviews
  - Surveys
  - Contextual Observations
  - Secondary Research
  - Intercept Interviews
  - Usability Tests
  - Probes/Diary Studies
  - Discovery Workshops

## Executing the Research - Conducting the research plan and documenting findings

- Come prepared with interview/survey questions, research materials, consent forms, etc.
- Have a method for organizing your materials and findings
