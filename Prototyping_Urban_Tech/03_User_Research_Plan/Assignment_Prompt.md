# User Research Plan

**Due**: Tuesday by 3pm | **Points**: 5 | **Format**: File upload | **Available after**: Feb 17 at 5pm

Based on your revised proposal and the feedback provided, produce a user research plan for the next two to three weeks that includes a breakdown of the research methods and tactics you aim to employ. This should include materials such as survey questions and interview scripts, as well as specific individuals or groups you have identified. You should begin reaching out to your potential users as soon as possible to set up times to collect research materials.

Submit a short description of the types of outreach you plan on conducting, a schedule (or estimate) for when you will be conducting your user research, as well as the scripts/materials you will be using.

Refer to your lecture notes and the [Principles and Tactics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MafPOlPHbkfASMGMWYTzxTcJf9_tBIl86UwEsOjG2cc/edit) provided.
