# Updated Project Proposal

**Due**: Thursday by 11:59pm | **Points**: 5 | **Format**: PDF or Word doc | **Length**: 3–5 pages

Having reflected on your initial ideas, refine your proposal to clarify your expected scope and direction in relation to Project, Product, and People.

This should include more specificity on who you want to target as your user group(s) and how you plan to engage with them, including proposed interview or survey scripts/ideas. Focus less on what you think the final outcomes might be, and instead think about the design processes you are interested in using to arrive there.

**Project**: Refine your project scope and goals, including how you expect to provide a meaningful service to your intended users.

**Product**: Though your product specifics will ultimately be driven by your users' needs, discuss your refined thoughts based on feedback from your initial proposal. Include thoughts on the types of data that might be relevant to the product.

**People**: Provide a clear analysis and description of your expected communities or user group(s), including any specific individuals you have identified as interviewees. Consult relevant material (lecture and resources) for direction in crafting these types of research documents.

Your proposal should be between three and five pages, including any interview or survey scripts/notes or images.

Submit your proposal as a pdf or word doc.
