Hi Daniel,

My apologies for the late feedback. Having seen a version of your product in progress, I think you are in a great place with both your technical development as well as your product concept and goals.

Moving forward, I recommend deep-diving into a **competitor analysis** if you haven't already, and identifying how they fit into a typical user's experience. Identifying limitations and gaps in service will help you further refine both your product design language as well as hone how you articulate specific features to each of your proposed user groups.

One thing to consider as you begin to craft user outreach goals is leaving yourself more open to what kinds of services and features each user group may been keen on engaging with. It may end up being that you further **segment the experiences** (between individuals and institutions), or that these user groups follow similar general UI/UX patterns in your tool.

As part of this, continue to consider the **expertise-levels** of your potential users, and how you can bring people into your experience through information sharing and **affordances** (aspect of your design that 'teach' a user how to engage along the way).

Given that you are working toward a functional technical prototype (and potential product beta), the **underlying data** you work with needs to be carefully considered. I know you are already working very considerately with these data, and I encourage you to include some discussion of what data may be relevant to your users in your research process.
