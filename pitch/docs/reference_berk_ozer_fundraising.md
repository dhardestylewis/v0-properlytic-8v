### Key Points Relevant to Deck Design

1. **Every VC call is a pitch** — even casual ones. The deck is always an audition.
2. **Sprint fundraising** — compress the raise into 2-3 weeks. All intros fired at once.
3. **Right intros > more intros** — volume matters, but quality of source matters more.
4. **Don't let investors decide before the call** — deck triggers "should I invest?" in 60 seconds. A blurb triggers "should I take 30 minutes?" — much easier bar. Send blurb first, save deck for after call is booked.
5. **Cold DMs signal desperation** — only reach out with genuine, specific match.
6. **Talk to dream investor last** — sharpen pitch with smaller funds first.
7. **Raise to hit a milestone** — trace every dollar to a decision. "$3M to hit 500 paying customers in 18 months" > "$2M at $20M because that's what everyone does."
8. **Best way to close: know you'll survive without it** — have a cockroach plan. Confidence is hard to fake.
9. **Don't over-raise** — every extra dollar raises the bar for next round traction.
10. **Never put valuation in the deck** — say it verbally, keep it flexible. A written valuation becomes an anchor you can't move.
