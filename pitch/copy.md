# Homecastr — Short Pitch Copy

## Fundraising blurb (Evalyze / investor platforms)

We're building the foundation model for real estate. Free forecasts become the standard homeowners and brokers judge price against. Chats with Homecastr reveal buying/selling intent, and that data is what we sell via API to single-family investors and operators.

## Vercel for Startups — "How can we help?"

Homecastr is a Next.js app deployed on Vercel serving real-time property forecasts across 1M+ parcels. We're scaling from a Houston pilot to 5+ metros and need Pro-tier resources (bandwidth, edge functions, analytics) to support the traffic growth without burning runway on infrastructure.
