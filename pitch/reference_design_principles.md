# Pitch Deck V3 — Design Principles

## Narrative Arc
Gap → Magic → Proof → Scale → Ask

## Core Rules
1. Every slide has ONE takeaway — if you need to read to understand it, it fails
2. Big visuals > tables — a screenshot is worth 10 bullet points
3. Numbers should be huge — 14% Median Error, 8x LTV:CAC, $15B TAM
4. Show, don't tell — visuals carry the story, text supports

## What's Working (Keep)
- Title slide — clean, bold, memorable tagline
- TAM/SAM/SOM concentric circles — visual, scannable
- Stat boxes on traction slide — bold numbers, easy to absorb
- GTM phased timeline — visual, shows progression
- Closing slide mirrors title slide

## What's Not Working (Replace)
- Competitive landscape table → 2x2 positioning quadrant
- Business Model double-table → giant LTV:CAC stat + simple pricing visual
- Problem slide bullet lists → visual side-by-side (Zillow vs Homecastr)
- Solution slide jargon intro → outcome-first ("See where any property is heading")
- Product slide bullet list → full-bleed product screenshot with callout annotations
- Flywheel + defensibility list → full-size flywheel diagram only

## Berk Ozer VC Advice (Applied)
- #4: Deck triggers "should I invest?" in 60 sec — every slide must instant-scan
- #7: Trace every dollar to a milestone on the Ask slide
- #10: No valuation in deck — say it verbally only
- #8: Convey confidence — show you'll survive without the round
