Properlytic is an API-first forecasting platform that brings institutional-grade risk intelligence to the residential real estate market. Instead of a single point estimate, we provide time-stamped, probabilistic forecasts with confidence bands and scenario views, empowering buyers, sellers, and homeowners to make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 The Vision

Real estate is the largest financial decision for most, yet consumers rely on backward-looking comps and broad indices. Properlytic changes this by offering a forward-looking view that quantifies risk and makes uncertainty explicit at the property level.

Our long-term vision is to become the national decision layer for residential real estate—delivering forecasts, risk ranges, and alerts that outperform today’s portals and spreadsheets.

## 💡 Key Features

*   **Probabilistic Forecasts:** 256 Monte Carlo scenario paths per property.
*   **Property-Level Granularity:** Insights specific to the building, unit, and micro-location.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** "What if" views for rates, inventory, and policy shifts.
*   **API-First Design:** Built for integration into underwriting, portfolio monitoring, and advisory workflows.
*   **Open Evaluation:** Transparent model monitoring (coverage, drift, segment accuracy).

## 🛠️ Technology

Properlytic ingests public records, retrains frequently, and delivers fast, interpretable forecasts at parcel scale.

## 👥 Team

*   **Daniel Hardesty Lewis** (Founder/CEO-CTO): Leads modeling, data engineering, and product.

## 📈 Market & Validation

We are targeting the ~$13T U.S. residential market. Our go-to-market strategy involves a dual track:
1.  **Public Distribution:** Free consumer layer to drive adoption and "standard-setting."
2.  **Institutional Pilots:** Paid API access for lenders, servicers, and investors requiring auditable, scenario-level forecasts.
